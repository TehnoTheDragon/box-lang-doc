# ðŸ“” Story
Story of idea to create a programming language box is started when I first had an idea to create large project (game). 

I wanted to create first a simple programming language to create mods for this game, I could use Lua or something like this.  
But I wanted something with more functionality and tools probably, I don't really remember, but what I surely though is to create this language modular in all ways of the word modular.  

Many times I design a syntax and had big plans for this language, many times I rewrote syntax of this language same as it's philosophy.  
I still at the unsure point of philosophy and syntax of this language. But each time I study more stuff, new languages, new techologies, problems what developers may have when develop something, I change my mind about philosopy of the box language.

In date of 06/2024 I have already some ideas about this language, it is more about how you read and write code, I decided to make stricts to what each keyword does, so there will no confussion when you read a code.  
Also with this strict rules about what each keyword does, makes it really easy to find patterns in code and understand them on fly (probably, that depends on person).  

Before I wanted my language be like `C` or `C++` but better, now I moved to `Rust` and it's changed my mind about what I want my language to be or be better than.  
Of course I want my language be better, I don't know what future will do with it, I don't know if I ever write some compiler to create this language, but I will try.

I want my language be strict but at the same time some aspects should be flexible enough to be able extend the language capabilities, to keep it in a good state.  
Maybe until release of the language it will be very unstable because everything might change in the next update until I make it more stable and release.

_To __NOT__ make this story too long, I won't probably add anything here anymore, unless I find something important._

## ðŸ“„ Summary
Box Lang emerged from the ambition to create a modular language initially intended for game modding but evolved to serve various domains like game development, software engineering, and embedded systems. The focus is on strict keyword design for clear, unambiguous code, inspired by the strengths and weaknesses of languages like C++, C, and Rust. Box aims to balance strict rules with flexibility, allowing for growth and adaptation to future technologies. The journey involves constant iteration and refinement to achieve a language that is both intuitive and powerful.

+ Vision: Create a language with a clear syntax where each keyword serves a distinct purpose, enhancing code readability and pattern recognition.

+ Evolution: Box has shifted from a C/C++ influenced language to incorporating insights from Rust, aiming to offer better functionality and clarity.

+ Future: Committed to a flexible yet structured approach, Box Lang seeks to grow organically, adapting to new programming paradigms and developer needs.
