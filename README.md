# Story
Story of idea to create a programming language box is started when I first had an idea to create large project (game). 

I wanted to create first a simple programming language to create mods for this game, I could use Lua or something like this.  
But I wanted something with more functionality and tools probably, I don't really remember, but what I surely though is to create this language modular in all ways of the word modular.  

Many times I design a syntax and had big plans for this language, many times I rewrote syntax of this language same as it's philosophy.  
I still at the unsure point of philosophy and syntax of this language. But each time I study more stuff, new languages, new techologies, problems what developers may have when develop something, I change my mind about philosopy of the box language.

In date of 06/2024 I have already some ideas about this language, it is more about how you read and write code, I decided to make stricts to what each keyword does, so there will no confussion when you read a code.  
Also with this strict rules about what each keyword does, makes it really easy to find patterns in code and understand them on fly (probably, that depends on person).  

Before I wanted my language be like `C` or `C++` but better, now I moved to `Rust` and it's changed my mind about what I want my language to be or be better than.  
Of course I want my language be better, I don't know what future will do with it, I don't know if I ever write some compiler to create this language, but I will try.
